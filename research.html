    <p><paper>Flying High? Legalization and the Black Market for Cannabis </paper></p>
    <p>Are cannabis legalization policies efficient at fighting the black market?
        Using crowd-sourced data on black-market prices in the U.S between 2000 and 2019,
        I show legalizing recreational cannabis resulted in illegal cannabis prices dropping
        by more than 15 %. The implementation of legal retail sales strengthens this result.
        This suggests legalization would reduce market power on the black market for cannabis.
        Yet, the extent to which - or whether at all - legalizing recreational cannabis
        causes its black market to shrink is unclear.
        Such a drop in price could indeed be symptomatic of reduced costs
        or enhanced competition on the black market itself,
        when legalization brings down the risk of being detected for the illegal branch and,
        thereby, lowers entry and production costs on this market.
        Combining information on legal and illegal prices with data on cannabis consumption in the state of Washington,
        I estimate a structural model where cannabis retailers compete against the black market.
        My results shed light on the cannabis consumption responses to price and policy and, ultimately,
        enable policymakers to determine the provision of legal and illegal cannabis under various
        <em>post-legalization</em> scenarios.

        <p><paper>Weeding out the Dealers? The Economics of Cannabis Legalization</paper>
        <author><br> with Emmanuelle Auriol and Alice Mesnard </author></p>
        <paper_status> under review  </paper_status>

        <p> We model consumer choices for cannabis in a risky environment and determine the supply of cannabis
            under prohibition and legalization.
            While introducing a legal market reduces the profits of illegal providers,
            it increases cannabis consumption.
            We show that this trade-off can be overcome by combining legalization with sanctions
            against users and suppliers of illegal products, and improvements to the quality of legal products.
            Numerical applications to the US highlight how our proposed policy mix can control
            the increase in cannabis consumption <em>post-legalization</em> and throttle the illegal market.
            The eviction prices we predict to drive dealers out of business are much lower than
            the prices of legal cannabis in the states that opted for legalization,
            leaving room for the black market to flourish.
            Analyzing the compatibility of several policy goals put forward in the public debate,
            including maximizing tax revenue and minimizing psychotropic consumption,
            we shed light on the less favorable outcomes of recent legalization reforms
            and suggest a new way forward. </p>

    <p><paper>Temporary Visas against Smuggling</paper><author><br> with Emmanuelle Auriol and Alice Mesnard</author></p>
    <paper_status>in progress</paper_status>
    <p> Is there a way of undermining dangerous human smuggling activities and controlling immigration?
        We model the supply of human smuggling services and the demand from workers in low wage countries
        and study how temporary visa schemes can be designed to drive smugglers out of business while meeting
        labor market needs in host countries.
        The policy trade-off between migration control and liberalized borders can be overcome
        by combining internal and external controls with a regulated market for temporary visas.
        On this market, visa duration and price are set at 'eviction' levels -i.e. to throttle smugglers' businesses.
        We use information on illegal migrants from Senegal to Spain and
        the Democratic Republic of Congo to South-Africa to calibrate eviction prices of visas
        and subsequent variations in migration flows.
        Our results highlight important constraints for governments seeking to prevent temporary workers' overstay,
        especially on South-North routes.
