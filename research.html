    <p><paper>Flying High? Legalization and the Black Market for Cannabis </paper></p>
    <p>To which extent do cannabis legalization policies undermine the black market?
Using the Trans-High Market Quotation US crowd-sourced data, I employ both difference-in-difference
and event-study designs and show legalizing recreational cannabis yields a drop in prices for illegal cannabis reaching 18\% and a rise in THC potency by up to 2\%, at equilibrium.
I add up to these results evaluating a structural model of demand for cannabis, using legal price data from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board and consumption microdata from the WA BRFSS.
Consumers are sensitive to both price and THC potency.
Yet,  unlike changes in THC potency, changes in prices yield little substitution between legal and illegal products.
Counterfactual analysis presents high quality provision as a creditable tool to drive illegal retailers out of the market.

        <p><paper>Weeding out the Dealers? The Economics of Cannabis Legalization</paper>
        <author><br> with Emmanuelle Auriol and Alice Mesnard </author></p>
        <paper_status> under review  </paper_status>

        <p> We model consumer choices for cannabis in a risky environment and determine the supply of cannabis
            under prohibition and legalization.
            While introducing a legal market reduces the profits of illegal providers,
            it increases cannabis consumption.
            We show that this trade-off can be overcome by combining legalization with sanctions
            against users and suppliers of illegal products, and improvements to the quality of legal products.
            Numerical applications to the US highlight how our proposed policy mix can control
            the increase in cannabis consumption <em>post-legalization</em> and throttle the illegal market.
            The eviction prices we predict to drive dealers out of business are much lower than
            the prices of legal cannabis in the states that opted for legalization,
            leaving room for the black market to flourish.
            Analyzing the compatibility of several policy goals put forward in the public debate,
            including maximizing tax revenue and minimizing psychotropic consumption,
            we shed light on the less favorable outcomes of recent legalization reforms
            and suggest a new way forward. </p>

    <p><paper>Temporary Visas against Smuggling</paper><author><br> with Emmanuelle Auriol and Alice Mesnard</author></p>
    <paper_status>in progress</paper_status>
    <p> Is there a way of undermining dangerous human smuggling activities and controlling immigration?
        We model the supply of human smuggling services and the demand from workers in low wage countries
        and study how temporary visa schemes can be designed to drive smugglers out of business while meeting
        labor market needs in host countries.
        The policy trade-off between migration control and liberalized borders can be overcome
        by combining internal and external controls with a regulated market for temporary visas.
        On this market, visa duration and price are set at 'eviction' levels -i.e. to throttle smugglers' businesses.
        We use information on illegal migrants from Senegal to Spain and
        the Democratic Republic of Congo to South-Africa to calibrate eviction prices of visas
        and subsequent variations in migration flows.
        Our results highlight important constraints for governments seeking to prevent temporary workers' overstay,
        especially on South-North routes.
