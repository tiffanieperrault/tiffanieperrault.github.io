    <p>To which extent do cannabis legalization policies undermine the black market?
        I assemble a novel dataset on US city-level prices and THC potencies, used as proxies for quality, in both prohibition and legalization environments.
        I employ both difference-in-difference and event-study designs and show legalizing recreational cannabis yields an immediate and sensible drop in equilibrium prices (up to 18%), as well as a delayed and limited (up to 2%) increase in equilibrium quality.
        This effect on price is driven by medium potency products being subject to important decreases in price, whereas the price of the most potent products increases <i>ex-post</i>.
        This heterogeneity suggests legalization selecting high potency products on the black market. 
        While the empirical literature has overlooked consumer preferences for cannabis quality, policy design cannot ignore this dimension. 
        To better understand how quality affects the demand and supply of cannabis, I complement the analysis by evaluating a structural model accounting for quality, combining administrative data on legal prices and consumption microdata for the state of Washington. 
        Cross-price elasticities of consumption between legal and illegal cannabis are relatively small. 
        However, changes in THC potency yield sensible substitution between the two products. 
        Counterfactual analysis presents high quality provision as a creditable tool to drive illegal retailers out of the market.

        <p> We model consumer choices for cannabis in a risky environment and determine the supply of cannabis
            under prohibition and legalization.
            While introducing a legal market reduces the profits of illegal providers,
            it increases cannabis consumption.
            We show that this trade-off can be overcome by combining legalization with sanctions
            against users and suppliers of illegal products, and improvements to the quality of legal products.
            Numerical applications to the US highlight how our proposed policy mix can control
            the increase in cannabis consumption <em>post-legalization</em> and throttle the illegal market.
            The eviction prices we predict to drive dealers out of business are much lower than
            the prices of legal cannabis in the states that opted for legalization,
            leaving room for the black market to flourish.
            Analyzing the compatibility of several policy goals put forward in the public debate,
            including maximizing tax revenue and minimizing psychotropic consumption,
            we shed light on the less favorable outcomes of recent legalization reforms
            and suggest a new way forward. </p>

    <p> Is there a way of undermining dangerous human smuggling activities and controlling immigration?
        We model the supply of human smuggling services and the demand from workers in low wage countries
        and study how temporary visa schemes can be designed to drive smugglers out of business while meeting
        labor market needs in host countries.
        The policy trade-off between migration control and liberalized borders can be overcome
        by combining internal and external controls with a regulated market for temporary visas.
        On this market, visa duration and price are set at 'eviction' levels -i.e. to throttle smugglers' businesses.
        We use information on illegal migrants from Senegal to Spain and
        the Democratic Republic of Congo to South-Africa to calibrate eviction prices of visas
        and subsequent variations in migration flows.
        Our results highlight important constraints for governments seeking to prevent temporary workers' overstay,
        especially on South-North routes.
